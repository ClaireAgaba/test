    <h1 class="heading"> Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p> HTML ( <span class="heading">H</span>yper<span class="heading">T</span>ext <span class="heading">M</span>arkup <span class="heading">L</span>anguage) is the code that is used
         to structure a web page 
        and its content. For example, content could be 
        structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, 
        or using images and data tables.

    <h2 id="what"> so what is html? </h2>
    <p> HTML is a<strong> markup language </strong> that defines the structure 
        of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements,
         which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way,
         or act a certain way. forexample, if we wanted a line to stand by itself, we could specify that 
         it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph tag.</p>

    <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
    <ol>

<li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p),
    wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element 
    begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li> 
 <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes 
     a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — 
     in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</li>
     <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
        <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>
</ol>
